My own custom sorting algorithm. (uniqueness counts)

Given an array of randomly generated integers, there exists a premade array "bridge",
    of the same size as the max value of the generated integers. 

The sort algorithms then takes each number as the index to the char-array and replaces
    the existing char with the integer. After all integers are placed, a second loop
    places every non-null value back into the original array, now sorted. 

As the intermediate char array has to correspond with the size of the integers, this would
    not be suited in a small memory environemnt. This algorithms also does not handle duplicates,
    but truncates the list to unique values.
