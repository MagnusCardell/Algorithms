My own custom sorting algorithm. (uniqueness counts)

Given an array of randomly generated integers, there exists a premade array filled with a
    a default char value,of the same size as the max value of the generated integers. 
    There also is an empty array that is ready for the final correct order. 

The sort algorithms then takes each number as the index to the char-array and replaces
    the existing char with the integer. After all integers are placed, a second loop
    checks every value of the destination array. If the value is not the default char,
    it is appended to the final destination array. 

As the intermediate char array has to correspond with the size of the integers, this would
    not be suited in a small memory environemnt. This algorithms do not handle duplicates,
    but truncates the list to unique values.
