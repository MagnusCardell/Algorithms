Given a network cintaining several nodes and connecting liens.
Each lin ehas a given bandwitdh
Bandwitdh represent the max capacity for each line

Linear Programming problem:
    Maximize/Minimize outcome of values from a mathematical model concisting of a number of constraints

Optimum bandwitdh - maximum revenue given a set of (constraining) points.
