A. Reading

    1. Please (re)read sections 6.1 and 6.2 carefully.

B. Exercises

    1. Implement the solution given for the longest increasing subsequence problem given in section 6.2. Have your program read a list of numbers from a file, and output the length of the longest increasing subsequence. Please submit your code through git.

    2. Implement the (slow) recursive solution mentioned in the text box for the longest increasing subsequence problem, and compare the running time with your previous solution (for several input sizes).Please submit your code through git.

    3.[C] Estimate, empirically, a function that approximates the running time of the recursive approach. For example, is it close to 3n4.5?

    4.[C] Exercise 6.1, page 177.

    5.[C] Exercise 6.2.

    6.[C] Exercise 6.3.

    7.[C] Exercise 6.8, page 179.

    8. Implement your solution to problem 6.8 in such a way that it reads in the two strings from a file (put each string on a line by itself), and then prints out the longest common substring. Please submit your code using git.
