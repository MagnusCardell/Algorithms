Homework 12   Due Tuesday, 3-6-18
A. Divide and conquer

    1.[C] Exercise 2.11, page 73.

    2.[C] Exercise 2.15.

    3.[C] Exercise 2.18, page 74.

B. Binary search

    1. Create an array of random integers, sort them, and then use binary search to find the index of some particular value. Please write the binary search part of the code from scratch. Please submit the C++ code via git. 

    2. Create a vector of strings, such that the strings are in alphabetical order. It is ok to hard-code a set of strings that are already in alphabetical order. Then create a binary search function that works to find a particular word among the vector of strings, similar to your first binary search. Please submit the C++ code via git. 

C. Reading

    1. Please read section 3.1, pages 80-82.

D. Exercise

    1. Implement a stack data structure as a C++ class. Here is a concise definition for a stack. Please use a simple array as the basis for your data structure. Your stack should have a constructor whose argument gives the maximum number of elements to be stored in the stack (thus allowing you to allocate an appropriate fixed-size array), as well as push and pop methods. Please submit the C++ code via git.
