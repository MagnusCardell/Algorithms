A. Exercises

    1.[C] (warmup) Write a short C++ program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 10. When you are done, paste it into the homework page that you reach by clicking the letter C on the left. --> see first_print.cpp

    2.[C] Type in the example code for timing a simple loop, compile and run it. Try clicking on the word 'elapsed_time' in the source file! Put some example output on your homework page. --> see timed_computation.cpp

B. Sorting

    1.[C] Design your own sorting algorithm, at a high level, and describe it in English on your homework page. Aim to make your own sorting algorithm, different than what other people do-- it does NOT need to be efficient. You can assume that you will be sorting distinct integers in a C++ array. --> see custom_sort.txt

    2. Take a look at this code for an example of one way to implement a sorting algorithm. The input is an array of N randomly chosen integers between zero and a billion, and the action of the algorithm depends on repeatedly swapping the positions of two array elements.
    --> see sort.cpp

    3. Implement your own sorting algorithm, or, if that isn't really practical, some other sorting algorithm, in C++. --> see custom_sort.cpp

    4.[C] Modify your code so that you can get timing information, for sorting different sizes of arrays, and copy your C++ code onto your homework page.

C. Reading

    1.[C] In the next class, we will be discussing the use of assembly language on these machines. Please use the usual compiler with the -S flag to print out the assembly code corresponding to your first simple program above, and paste it into your homework page.
    --> see first_print.s

    2.[C] If you have been in the Hardware Design class, please take half an hour to an hour to brush up on assembly language programming, perhaps using materials from that course. If you are new to assembly language, please take a couple of hours to dive in and learn about it. A gentle introduction is available here: PC Assembly Tutorial In either case, don't worry: we will not be spending very much of the term on assembly, just enough to clarify what is really happening when we compile and run C++ code. When you have completed your review, please briefly describe what you did to review assembly language in the response to this homework question.

    3. Now go back and add a comment to the assembly code you pasted into the homework page, pointing out where the loop is happening.
