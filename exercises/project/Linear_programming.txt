440 demand 920

30 employees
each make 20 carpets per month and $2000 a month
no initial surplus of carpets

1. Overtime: pay 80% more, max 30% longer
2. Hiring: $320, Firing: $400 per worker
3. Storing surplus: cost 8$/carpet, must end year with no surplus

w_i = number of workers during the ith month; w_0 = 30.
x_i = number of carpets made during the ith month.
o_i = number of carpets ,ade by overtime in month i.
h_i = number of workers hired during month i
f_i = number of workers fired during month i
s_i = number of carpets stored at end of month i; s_0 = 0.

Variables must be non-negative:
    w_i, x_i, o_i, h_i, f_i, s_i >= 0 for i=1...12

Total number of carpets made per month is the sum of regular and overtime production:
    x_i = 20 w_i + o_i

For each i=1...12, workers can change at each month:
    w_i = w_{i-1} + h_i - f_i 

The number of carpets stored at the end of each month is previous storage + production - demand:
    s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i - d_i 

Overtime is limited
    o_i <= 6w_i

Objective is to minimize cost:
    min( 2000(sum(w_i)) + 320(sum(h_i)) + 400(sum(f_i)) + 8(sum(s_i)) + 180(sum(o_i)))

demand:
    d1 = 460 a 
    d2 = 500 b
    d3 = 540 c
    d4 = 800 d
    d5 = 920 e
    d6 = 680 f
    d7 = 740 g
    d8 = 780 h
    d9 = 840 i
    d10 = 620 j
    d11 = 480 k
    d12 = 440 l

With 74 variables, all this work is put into mathlab file named "Algo_final_LP" that is in this directory.
