A. Reading

    1. Please read the first part of chapter 7, up to the middle of page 194 (stop at section 7.1.3).

B. Exercises

    1.[C] Exercise 7.1, page 222.

Consider the following linear program,
    maximize 5x+3y
    5x-2y >= 0
    x + y <= 7
    x <= 5
    x >= 0
    y >= 0
Plot the feasible region and identify the optmial solution. 

I whish I could submit a picture of my plot, but I came to the following optimal max point: x=2 and y=5. Let me know if you want the picture. 

    2.[C] Exercise 7.3, page 222.

max( 1000x + 1200y + 12000z)
2x + y + 2z <= 100
x + y + z <=60
x <= 40
y <= 30
z <= 20
x,y,z >= 0

Optmial solution lies at x=10, y=30, y=20

    3.[C] Suppose you have a map with the positions of ten cities, and you want to decide where to build a set of supply centers for your business. Each supply center will be in a city, but a supply center can also supply one or more other cities, provided each other city is no more than 50 miles away. How can you figure out the minimum number of supply centers necessary? What would you do if there are thousands of cities, instead of just ten?

    4.[C] Exercise 7.2, page 222.

x1 = Mex -> NY
x2 = Mex -> CA
x3 = Kan -> NY
x4 = Kan -> CA

min(3x1 + x2 + 2x3 + 3x4)
x1 + x2 <= 8 
x3 + x4 <= 15
x1 + x3 >= 10
x2 + x4 >= 13
x1,x2,x3,x4 >= 0



C. Followup

    1.[C] Think about the dynamic programming problems we have worked on so far. Are there any questions you have about them? What makes a particular problem suited for dynamic programming?
