snippet 10 Answer

Outermost loop:
 - cost of initialize i: 1 cycle
 - condition check: .5 cycle
 
Middle loop:
 - cost of initialize j: 1 cycle
 - condition: .5 cycles

Innermost loop:
 - cost of initialize k: 1 cycle
 - condition: .5 cycles
 - body: 2 cycles

Assume inner loop is fixed at 10 cycles

Calculating the loops of two loops
    1+2+3+...+n 
    1/2 * n(n+1) * 10

Now, including the innermost loop...
    Max value of j is 100, giving the inner loop about 20 cycles
    Using 20 as a max value, extrapolate into a 3d cube. (histogram)
    x = n 
    y = n+1
    z(max) = 20
    Average the height out to 5, then calculate the sum. 
    5 * (1/2(n)(n+1)) = 25.250, actual timing = 140.000
